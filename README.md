## Purpose
The purpose for this web portfolio is to test my self if i am capable of producing a good responsive mobile and desktop website. As well as showing it off my talents, abilities and coding experience to potential employers.

## Funtionality/Features
My Web Portfolio works for both platform mobile and desktop and even tablets. 
### Homepage
For deskop, upon opening the web portfolio, users will see the title "David Bui Web Portfolio" homepage and have the following options located on the left under the logo, which are clickable HOME, ABOUT, SKILL, CONTACT. Also there is a footer located at the bottom of the page that contains my name and my social contacts Linkedin and Github. These social contacts are clickable and if users click one of them it will send them to my linkedin or github page. Furthermore there is a beautifully made logo using html/css only located on the top left corner of the page. It also has a navbar located on the left, which changes the background to white and the font to black when users hovers the pointer over it.

For mobile, user are presented with the same title heading from the desktop. One good thing when user uses mobile, there is a very tasty hamburger menu located at the top right corner of the mobile page. When user touches the hamburger menu it will show the following links (HOME, ABOUT, SKILL, CONTACT) and if pressed on one of the links it will change the background of that link to a light greenish color and goes to that page.
### ABOUT ME PAGE
Both mobile and desktop has contents explaining who i am. The only difference is that mobile it has 1 heading (ABOUT ME) and 1 subheading (Biography), whereas desktop has one heading (About me with a line beneath) and a fixed navbar located on the left.
### SKILL PAGE
Both mobile and desktop has the icon image of ruby, html5 and css. This pages reveals the software programs that i have learnt so far.
### CONTACT PAGE
Both mobile and desktop has a subheading called Get In Touch, beneath that subheading there is a form for user to enter there details. They must enter all (first name, last name, email and message) for it to work. Otherwise if user doesn't and press/click sumbit it will tell the user "please fill in this field". The only difference between mobile or desktop page is my github and linkedin links are located below the submit for mobile and for desktop it is located at the right side below Contact heading. Note for mobile the links are the picture not the words and there is a good reason for that I want to make to easy for user to press, since mobile display are very small.
